\section{Abstract}
The paper examines and describes the effect of different sizes and types of feature vectors in the machine learning bot. To reach our goal, we have created four machine learning bots with different sizes of the feature vectors. Firstly, machine learning bots were trained. Secondly, they competed against each other and five other agents, aiming to draw conclusions based on the win and loss rate from each bot depending on the phase they were playing. Outcomes were provided and examined using tables which reveal the number of wins and losses and the average improvement or deterioration of each machine learning bot. As a result, we found out that the ratio of performance win/loss stays consistent between testing in phase 1 and 2 and testing in phase 1. We concluded that depending on the phase, the performance of individual bots, such as ml or ml\_extended, is better in comparison to the rest of the variations.
